# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation steps.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the customer churn dataset.
- Handled missing and incorrect data (e.g., blank 'TotalCharges' replaced with 0).
- Converted data types and cleaned categorical columns.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized feature distributions.
- Analyzed churn distribution across customer attributes.
- Identified important patterns affecting churn.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Created dummy variables for categorical data.
- Scaled numerical data for model input.

### 4. Model Training & Evaluation
- Trained models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

## âœ… Results
- Identified the most influential features contributing to churn.
- Achieved baseline model performance and demonstrated full ML pipeline.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This notebook provides a complete workflow for churn prediction and is a solid foundation for further model tuning and deployment.
