# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn using a dataset of customer details and behavior. It involves exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and applying machine learning models to predict churn.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Workflow Summary

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Loaded the customer churn dataset
   - Performed initial inspection and handled missing values

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Replaced blank values in 'TotalCharges' with 0
   - Converted data types appropriately
   - Removed unnecessary columns

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized the distribution of features like tenure, MonthlyCharges, etc.
   - Analyzed relationships between features and churn

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created dummy variables for categorical features
   - Normalized numerical data

5. **Modeling**
   - Applied Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports

6. **Results**
   - Provided performance metrics for each model
   - Identified key features impacting customer churn

## Conclusion
This notebook successfully demonstrates a pipeline from raw data to predictive modeling for customer churn. Further model tuning and testing on additional datasets can improve accuracy.
